### [Remove Elements from an Array Using slice Instead of splice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/remove-elements-from-an-array-using-slice-instead-of-splice)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
- The difference between `splice` and `slice` method is that the `slice` method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one.
- The `slice` method takes 2 two arguments for the indices to begin and end the slice (the end is non-inclusive).
- If you do not want to mutate the original array, you can use the `slice` method.
